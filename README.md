# Fedora Workstation Installation Guide

*Installation guide and **personal** post-installation steps.  
The purpose of this document is to provide a clean, minimalist, secure, gaming-ready, Fedora setup.*

*Scripts are provided for your convenience, but all of them are open and -I hope- legible enough for you to update them at will.  
I've also added comments for more complex parts, and to offer variants.*

*Hope you enjoy this guide.*

## ‚è© Quick Start

### 1.1. Requirements

- a basic Fedora installation (Workstation Edition, with GNOME)

Highly recommended (but still **not** mandatory):

- an UEFI platform (the more up-to-date, the better)
- a TPM 2.0 chip
- Secure Boot enabled
- LUKS encryption enabled on all drives

These scripts are better run right after a fresh Fedora installation.  
On the very first reboot, after creating your account:

- disable `Location Services`
- disable `Automatic Problem Reporting`
- enable `Third-Party Repositories`

### 1.2. Available Scripts

Then, use the following scripts, in the following order.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Please **reboot** when asked.

#### 1.2.1. Base Setup

First, name your new system:

```bash
# "Pretty" name of the system, without restrictions
# (e.g: "System Name 01")
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname --pretty $pretty_hostname

# Static name of the system, containing only lowercase letters, numbers and/or dashes
# (e.g: "system-name-01")
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname --static $static_hostname
```

Then, run:

```bash
curl --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolandhemmer/fedora-workstation-guide/main/scripts/00-setup-base.sh | bash
# ‚úÖ Reboot when asked

curl --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolandhemmer/fedora-workstation-guide/main/scripts/01-setup-harden.sh | bash
# ‚úÖ Reboot when asked
```

#### 1.2.2. Nvidia Drivers

If you have an Nvidia GPU, run:

```bash
curl --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolandhemmer/fedora-workstation-guide/main/scripts/02-setup-nvidia.sh | bash
# ‚úÖ Reboot when asked
```

‚ö†Ô∏è A password will be asked during this step. This will allow the load of the Nvidia drivers and kernel modules even with Secure Boot enabled.  
At reboot, choose `Enroll MOK`, `Continue`, `Yes`, and enter the selected password. Reboot when done.

#### 1.2.3. Environment

Finish the basic installation with:

```bash
curl --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolandhemmer/fedora-workstation-guide/main/scripts/03-setup-codecs.sh | bash

curl --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolandhemmer/fedora-workstation-guide/main/scripts/04-setup-applications.sh | bash
```

#### 1.2.4. Theme

If you want to include a minimalist, flat, macOS-like GNOME theme, run:

```bash
flatpak install --assumeyes --user flathub com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager
```

Then, open the GNOME Extension Manager, and install the following extensions:

- Alphabetical App Grid
- Blur my Shell
- Dash to Dock
- Hide Top Bar
- User Themes

Then, run:

```bash
curl --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolandhemmer/fedora-workstation-guide/main/scripts/05-setup-theme.sh | bash
```

## üîÉ Automation

A script is provided to simplify all update chores (RPM, Flatpaks, firmware, etc.), and/or refresh the GNOME theme as well if needed.  
Use the following command to add it to your installation:

```bash
sudo curl --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolandhemmer/fedora-workstation-guide/main/scripts/update.sh --output /usr/bin/update
```

Once set up, run:

```bash
update --system
# to refresh RPM packages, Flatpaks and firmware

update --theme
# to refresh the GNOME theme as configured in this guide

update --all
# to do both
```

I recommend [setting up a CRON job](https://fedoramagazine.org/scheduling-tasks-with-cron/) calling this script to keep your system updated without effort.

## ü§ù Thanks

This humble guide is merely a compilation of what's existing out here already.  
I did spent **A LOT** of time searching, experimenting and formatting my poor PC to test all of this.

Alongside my own time, here's a list of the resources I used.
